# DSA210 PROJECT

## Project Idea

The objective of this project is to investigate the effects of climate change on agricultural prosuctivity and sustainability by exploring key factors such as temperature, rainfall, CO2 levels, and crop yield. by applying statistical analysis and machine learning methos, the aim is to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends that could help predict future impacts on agriculture. The dataset used for this project is provided by the Kaggle, 'Waqar Ali'.

## Plan 

1. **Data Collection**
   
   Import and preprocess the dataset from Kaggle, ensuring the correct handling of missing data and standardizing the data formats.
2. **Data Analysis**
   
   Investigate the relationships between climate factors (such as temperature and rainfall) and crop yield through visual tools like scatter plots. To measure the influence of climate variables on crop yield, regression analysis will be employed. Also examine how crop yield trends evolve over time in various regions to understand the role of geographic differences on agricultural productivity. Furthermore, evaluate the effect of extreme weather events on crop yield by correlating these events with changes in yield. Finally, various visualizations, such as line graphs and bar charts will be used to display the trends and relationships identified in the analysis.
 
  
4. **Reporting**

   Create a etailed report summarizing key findings, limitations, and suggestions for future research.

## Motivation 

Climate change presents a critical threat to global food security and the sustainability of agriculture. It is crucial to understand how changes in temperature, rainfall, and CO2 levels affect crop productivity in order to create effective adaptation strategies. This project integrates data science and environmental research to provide valuable insights for farmers, researchers who are working to reduce the negative impacts of climate change on agriculture.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is "Climate Change Impact on Agriculture" provided by Kaggle user 'Waqar Ali'. It includes the following variables:
- **Region**: The location where the data was collected.
- **Year**: The year of record.
- **Average_Temperature**: The average annual temperature (Â°C).
- **Precipitation**: The total annual rainfall (mm).
- **Crop_Yield**: The crop yield, measured in tons per hectare.
- **Extreme_Weather_Events**: Number of modeled extreme weather occurrences per year.

## Conclusion

The proposed project aims to examine the connection between climate variables and agricultural productivity. By identifying key correlations and trends, this analysis can support more informed decision-making for adapting farming practices to the evolving climate. Future research could expand the project by incorporating additional datasets, such as soil quality, fertilizer use, and socio-economic factors, to enhance the accuracy and applicability of predictions.
